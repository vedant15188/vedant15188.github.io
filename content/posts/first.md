Hey there! I know what you must be thinking, "Another blog? Really?" But hey, this blog is actually for me and not for you ðŸ˜‰. Although I do hope that you are able to discover new content or just learn something new from my posts.

I've been told that getting into the habit of writing regularly can be really beneficial and in general I've always shied away from putting things in writing outside of work, so I figured why not give it a shot?

In all honesty, I haven't written something in a "blog" format before, so I am not sure how this will turn out, but I'm excited to do this. Will it be cringe or will it be insightful? Only time will tell.

I'll be writing mostly about some cool research papers that I read or some commentary on YouTube videos I watch. It's be mostly tech focused, but I might get real and write something personal too. I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them.

Also, since I'm such a music fanatic, I'll also add a song/album and my personal thoughts about it that I'm currently listening to at the end of each post. So, stay tuned for that!

Today, I bring you, my favourite song from the Album Night Lights, by Gerry Mulligan Sextet. I've been listening to this album on repeat for the past few days and I just can't get enough of it. The whole album is a 10/10 masterpiece, but this song in particular is just so soothing and relaxing. Especially the ending, which is quite the way to end a song and I'd describe it as pure magic. Hope you enjoy and take care. âœ¨
