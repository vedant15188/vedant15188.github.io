Hey! I'm **Vedant Kashyap**, a Platform Engineer with over 6 years of experience building & scaling reliable cloud systems.

My journey has taken me from India to The Netherlands, working with companies like WeTransfer and JetBrains to streamline development processes and enable developer success through internal tools & workshops. Currently at JetBrains, I help our major clients deploy our products and migrate from legacy jetbrains products to modern ones with minimal downtime.

Outside of work, I'm a music enthusiast who can't survive without headphones and love splurging on a good pair of headphones. I'm also an avid reader, currently working through ["Red Dragon" by Thomas Harris](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41885262-red-dragon) and ["The Book of Disquiet" by Fernando Pessoa](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8388793-the-book-of-disquiet).

To unwind, I play badminton, game on FIFA or Satisfactory, and cheer for FC Bayern Munich and Max Verstappen on weekends.

Want to geek out over infra, music, books, or gaming? Feel free to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vedant-kashyap/)!
